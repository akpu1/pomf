[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pomf/pomf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pomf/pomf) [![devDependency Status](https://david-dm.org/pomf/pomf/dev-status.svg)](https://david-dm.org/pomf/pomf#info=devDependencies)

Pomf is a simple file uploading and sharing platform.

## Features

- One click uploading, no registration required
- A minimal, modern web interface
- Drag & drop supported
- Upload API with multiple response choices
  - JSON
  - HTML
  - Text
  - CSV
- Supports [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) and other screenshot tools

### Demo

See the real world example at [Pantsu.cat](https://pantsu.cat/).

## Requirements

Original development environment is Nginx + PHP5.5 + MySQL, but is confirmed to
work with Apache 2.4 and newer PHP versions. Should work with any other
PDO-compatible database.

## Install

For the purposes of this guide, we won't cover setting up Nginx, PHP, MySQL,
Node, or NPM. So we'll just assume you already have them all running well.

### Compiling

The assets are minified and combined using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

Assuming you already have Node and NPM working, compilation is easy. Use the
following shell code:

    npm install -g grunt-cli
    git clone https://github.com/pomf/pomf
    cd pomf/
    npm install
    grunt

After this, the pomf site is now compressed and set up inside `dist/`.

## Configuring

Front-end related settings, such as the name of the site, and maximum allowable file size, are found in `templates/site_variables.json`.  Changes made here will only take effect after rebuilding the site pages.  This may be done by running `grunt` from the root of the site directory.

Back-end related settings, such as database configuration, and path for uploaded files, are found in `static/php/includes/settings.inc.php`.  Changes made here take effect immediately.

If you intend to allow uploading files larger than 2 MB, you may also need to
increase POST size limits in `php.ini` and webserver configuration. For PHP,
modify `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` values. The configuration
option for nginx webserver is `client_max_body_size`.

A best practice is to disable executing `.php` files on the `POMF_URL` domain
for uploaded files. This assures that a malicious user cannot execute arbitrary
PHP code on the server.

## Using SQLite as DB engine

We need to create the SQLite database before it may be used by pomf.
Fortunately, this is incredibly simple.  

First create a directory for the database, e.g. `mkdir /var/db/pomf`.  
Then, create a new SQLite database from the schema, e.g. `sqlite3 /var/db/pomf/pomf.sq3 -init /home/pomf/sqlite_schema.sql`.
Then, finally, ensure the permissions are correct, e.g.
```bash
chown nginx:nginx /var/db/pomf
chmod 0750 /var/db/pomf
chmod 0640 /var/db/pomf/pomf.sq3
```

Finally, edit `php/includes/settings.inc.php` to indicate this is the database engine you would like to use.  Make the changes outlined below
```php
define('POMF_DB_CONN', '[stuff]'); ---> define('POMF_DB_CONN', 'sqlite:/var/db/pomf/pomf.sq3');`
define('POMF_DB_USER', '[stuff]'); ---> define('POMF_DB_USER', null);
define('POMF_DB_PASS', '[stuff]'); ---> define('POMF_DB_PASS', null);
```

*NOTE: The directory where the SQLite database is stored, must be writable by the web server user*

### Apache

If you are running Apache and want to compress your output when serving files,
add to your `.htaccess` file:

    AddOutputFilterByType DEFLATE text/html text/plain text/css application/javascript application/x-javascript application/json

Remember to enable `deflate_module` and `filter_module` modules in your Apache
configuration file.

### Migrating from MySQL to SQLite

MySQL is relatively complicated to administer, brings in many unneeded dependencies, and consumes
more resources than SQLite would, and result in worse performance for pomf.  Additonally, poorly configured installations have the potential
to pose a security risk.

Fortunately, it is incredibly simple to migrate your database.  This may be done on a live server, and should require
zero downtime.

_If doing this on a live server, you way wish to work in a subdirectory (or vhost, or equivelant), so that any complications or mistakes do not affect your main site.  
If you choose not to do so, know that mistakes in the changes outlined below, will only temporarily impact **uploading**, causing **Server error** to be displayed.  None of these steps are destructive, and are easily reverted._

Run the following commands as root, to dump your database, and make a SQLite database with the contents.  
```bash
mkdir /var/db/pomf
wget -O /tmp/m2s https://github.com/dumblob/mysql2sqlite/raw/master/mysql2sqlite.sh
mysqldump -u OLD_DB_USER -p OLD_DB_PASS pomf | sh /tmp/m2s | sqlite3 /var/db/pomf/sq3
rm /tmp/m2s
chown -R nginx:nginx /var/db/pomf #replace user as appropriate
chmod 0750 /var/db/pomf && chmod 0640 /var/db/pomf/sq3
```
Edit the file `php/includes/settings.inc.php`, in the subdirectory you just made, making the changes outlined below.
```php
define('POMF_DB_CONN', '[stuff]'); ---> define('POMF_DB_CONN', 'sqlite:/var/db/pomf/pomf.sq3');`
define('POMF_DB_USER', '[stuff]'); ---> define('POMF_DB_USER', null);
define('POMF_DB_PASS', '[stuff]'); ---> define('POMF_DB_PASS', null);
```

Then, run `make` to rebuild the website pages, and copy the new `settings.inc.php` file into place. 

All done! You may disable or uninstall MySQL if you wish.

## Contributing

We'd really like if you can take some time to make sure your coding style is
consistent with the project. Pomf follows [PHP
PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) and [Airbnb JavaScript
(ES5)](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/es5) (`airbnb/legacy`)
coding style guides. We use ESLint and PHPCS tools to enforce these standards.

You can also help by sending us feature requests or writing documentation and
tests.

Thanks!
